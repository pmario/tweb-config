tweb-config - ALPHA
===========

`tweb-config` is a shell script to get started with TiddlyWeb on the RaspberryPi.

This script is under heavy development, and may change quite a lot. I try to push versions, that I've tested.

If you find a bug, create an [issue](https://github.com/pmario/tweb-config/issues) at github or at the [TiddlyWeb](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/tiddlyweb). discussion group. Suggestions and pull requests are very welcome!

I'm new to shell scripting, so if you have some best practice advice, let my know :)

In the end this file will land in `/usr/local/bin` on the RasPi.

----

Usage
-----

There are 2 possibilities to use the script.

 1. as standard user
 2. as sudoer (user pi)

If you are loged as user `pi` on the RPi the command is like: 

 pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo tweb-config
   

The command above, will help you to setup your dependencies for TiddlyWeb and can help you to autostart your TiddlyWeb server on boot up as a [[daemon]].


If you start `tweb-config` as user `www-tweb` it help you to get the TiddlyWeb sttings going.

	www-tweb@raspberrypi ~/tweb $ tweb-config

----

Install the script
------------------

**Be sure you did the initial setup `raspi-config`**

* Change your pi password to a strong password. One, that you can remember :)
* Be sure you saw the RasPi IP address, the Pi printed it at startup.
  * If you can't remember it. type: `hostname -I` and note it.
* IMPORTANT set the  "memory split" to -> `16` .. we will need our memory but no graphics.
* SSH daemon should be active.
* You should expand your rootfs to use the maximum space.
* Reboot your Pi.

----

Optional Setps
--------------

The next steps are optional but you may need them in the future. eg: for backups ...

**If you exclusively work on your RasPi you may skip this**

* Create a new key pair with [[ssh-keygen]]
  * do _NOT_ use the default name
  * save it to `/home/<yourName>/.ssh/pi_rsa`
  * leave the password empty `<enter><enter>`
  * done
* Copy the newly created public key to your RasPi
  * `ssh-copy -i .ssh/pi_ras.pub pi@<RasPi IP address>`
  * answer the question with `yes`
  * done
* Connect to your Pi with `ssh pi@<RasPi IP address>`
  * again answer the questions with `yes`
* You should see an autologin prompt now
  * `pi@raspberrypi ~ $`
  * if not -- you did something wrong :/

TiddlyWeb Configuration
-----------------------

**On your Pi in the home dir - get the `tweb-config` file**

Get the file from github, make it executable and link it to `/usr/local/bin/`

	wget https://raw.github.com/pmario/tweb-config/master/tweb-config
	sudo ln -s /home/pi/tweb-config /usr/local/bin/tweb-config
	sudo chmod +x tweb-config

If you type:

	which tweb-config
	
you should get

	usr/local/bin/tweb-config
	
----

**On your Pi**

	cd ~
	sudo tweb-config

Follow the steps 1-6

1. Some Info
2. OS upgrade .. 20 min (class 4 SD card)
3. Install TWeb dependencies .. 7 min
4. New system user www-tweb .. 1 min
5. Install TiddlyWebWiki .. 6 min
6. Login as www-tweb .. 20 seconds
  
The other steps will be needed, when your TWeb instances are working

----

**On your Pi**

* Follow the steps printed by the "Login as www-tweb user"
* `su www-tweb` .. log into your www-tweb user - I hope, you can remember your PW
* `cd ~` .. to home directory
* `twinstance tweb`
* `cd tweb`
* `tweb-config` .. follow steps 1-26 (I'm joking ;)

1. List users - there should be "administrator" user only.
2. Create a new TiddlyWeb user .. follow the steps
3. Create a new TiddlyWiki .. follow the steps
4. Prepare TWeb for autorun on startup .. creates some files and directories

EXIT tweb-confg now

Do NOT use the last 2 commands atm. (except you read the source and understand what they do :)

Start the Server
----------------

**Start the server with:**

	twanager server IP PORT

see the info printed

----

**On your PC you can open your wikis now.**

The default URL looks like this:

	http://<yourIPHere>:8080/recipes/MyNewTW_public/tiddlers.wiki

TiddlyWebWiki got a cool new feature lately. It automatically creates a shortcut URL that can access your TiddlyWiki with:

	http://<yourIPHere>:8080/<WikiName>
	
The long URL address does still work.


**Login to get the private recipe/TiddlyWiki**

* `http://<yourIPHere>:8080/challenge`
* It will only work, if you did create a new user. GUEST is the default user.
* There is no "Logout" button yet. Just login with a different user
* The web UI is missing atm. But will be the next step :)

have fun!

PS: Do not activate "svscanboot" from the "sudo menue" except you know [daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html). There is not enough UI yet.
